Building websites and applications today has gotten more difficult. We need to build components. We need to cater for responsive design.

(Doesn't really have enough punch here. Maybe a story would be great to start off with)

While building components, we want to make our code easy-to-read. We want it to be maintainable and scalable.

It's a tough world out there.

I don't know how to pull the design part in, but I got to continue anyway.

As frontend developers, we want to build responsive and beautiful websites. We're the custodians of the web. People see what we create eventually. We're not alone. We usually work with designers.

Hiccups and communication is important. Communication with the designer is important to iron out issues with each other.

And so the thing about building beautiful websites is â€“ there's a process. Most of us do it this way => Design, Develop.

The problem is building the design in such a way that makes it sane and maintainable for us as developers. The goal is to make it easy for anyone to pick up your project and begin working on it immediately.

The goal is to help you reduce the fear in making CSS changes, for fear of breaking the website in unimaginable places.

The goal is to help you write code that you're confident is stable, well designed, uses the best practices and does the job well without you having to be afraid.

The goal is readdy to make you less afroid and more flexible when building components with CSS.

And with that I think I have a good transition. Start with FED, we're custodians of the web. But let me continue and see how it brings into the rest of the topic first.

So one challenge we face is bringing the design into reality by writing code that works on both mobile, desktop and any other device.

The second challenge we face is building lego blocks (components) that can be plugged into any part of our site with minimal changes to code.

Meh, this comes a little forceful this transition. It's not elegant enough. It doesn't bring in the topic very well.

What I want is to explain the different types.

And that's a challenge. The vocabulary we use is limited. We say things like Scale. Reusable. Modular. Maintainable. Responsive. But what does these all mean? We use these jargons without giving much of a thought to what they really mean. Is there a underlying guiding principle that we should follow to build components?

And there is.

Let's examine what needs to happen in a website that's scalable, reusable, modular and maintainable.

When we think about a website, we naturally begin with the smallest piece in mind. Text. Letters form words, words form paragraphs. They makes up the bulk of a page.

When responsive design come into play, we need to make it scale. But how? The first thing to scale, is to consider accessibility. And when we consider accessibility regarding text, we know there's a need to increase the font-size of text. Okay, this comes very forced as well.

Ugh. I don't have the mood to do this. I want to run away :(
